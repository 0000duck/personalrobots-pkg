<description brief="The STAIR Vision Library (latest)">

This package contains the latest code from the STAIR Vision
Library (SVL).  This ROS package does not modify the SVL in any way;
it simply provides a convenient way to download and compile the library
in a way that can be managed by the ROS dependency system.
