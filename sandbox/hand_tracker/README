To build the hand dataset, follow these steps. The data from all these steps
is store in /u/prdata

1) Retrieve the images and annotations:
rosrun cv_mech_turk session_results.py --session=hands-3-s --server=vm7.willowgarage.com:80 --saveto=results

This creates directories results/annotations and results/images, fetches xml descriptions of the hand
annotations, and converts them from relative to absolute coordinates.

Note: right now images 33 and 80 have a reversed annotation, so if you run the line above, you will have
to reverse the list of points of the polygon in frame0033.xml. Keep the first point in first position
and reverse the rest of the list (ie go through the polygon in opposite circular direction starting
from the same point)

2) Extract the hand polygons from the annotations:
python scripts/mt_results_to_hand_outlines.py --folder=results

This simply creates a simplified xml containing only the hand polygons. It used to do more.

3) Find an oriented bounding box containing the polygons, with the wrist-major axis vertical
python scripts/hand_outlines_to_oriented_bounding_boxes.py --folder=results

4) Crop the oriented bounding boxes from the images
python scripts/oriented_bounding_boxes_to_cropped_images.py --folder=results





To create additional data using Mechanical Turk:

1) rosrun cv_mech_turk submit_img.py --server=vm7.willowgarage.com:80 --session=hands-3-s /u/prdata/hand_data/flat_hands/images/frame00*

(Replace the image list with your own path). Follow the instructions at
http://pr.willowgarage.com/wiki/ROS/mturk/AnnotationTutorial
to annotate the images yourself or have them annotated by MTurk.
You may replace hands-3-s by a session you have created, in particular if you want the images annotated
by MTurk workers since hands-3-s is specifically restricted to the sandbox.

2) Repeat the first part
