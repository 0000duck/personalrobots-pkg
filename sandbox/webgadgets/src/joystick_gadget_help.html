This switch helps prevent accidental operation of the robot. To drive the robot around, hold down the button while using the two joysticks to move the base of the robot. The right joystick moves the base to the right, left, forward, and backward, while the left joystick rotates the base clockwise and counterclockwise. The 4 button moves the spine up, while the 2 button moves the spine down.</dd>
