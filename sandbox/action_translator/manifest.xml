  <description brief="Tools to convert between the old and new actions (robot_actions and actionlib)">
     This package provides tools that allow actionlib::ActionServer actions
    to communicate over the robot_actions protocol. This is extremely useful
    when an action needs to communicate with TREX.
    
    Once TREX supports actionlib actions and python has an actionlib::ActionClient
    interface implemented, this package should be deprecated.
