   Tools for collecting and managing data for the indoor person detection and tracking dataset
   These include:
       scripts/collect_data.sh: runs data collection system on the robot
       scripts/chop_bag.py: converts a collection of bags into a series of contiguous scenes, cutting wherever recording was paused
       scripts/plot_bags.py: plots when each topic was present in a collection of bags (this is helpful for checking that no sensors died)
       stereo_playback.launch: A launch file that uses environment variables to play video from a bag file
       scripts/stereo_multi_playback.py: Plays back more than one video topic at a time (may need to use -r 0.5 to keep the video synchronized)
