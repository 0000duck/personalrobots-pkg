OST is an open source version of fast stereo algorithms.  These
algorithms are also incorporated into OpenCV.

This distribution contains the stereo libraries, a GUI calibration app
using the OpenCV calibration routines, and a libdc1394 interface to
Videre Design stereo cameras.

To install, first install the latest version of OpenCV and
libdc1394v2.  Then modify the Makefile to point to the appropriate
directories of these distributions, and run "make".  Executables are
in the bin/ directory, libraries in lib/.  

Run bin/ost to get a stereo GUI and the calibration routines.

Currently bin/ost will exit if it doesn't find a camera, but this will
be changed soon, because it can also run from files.
