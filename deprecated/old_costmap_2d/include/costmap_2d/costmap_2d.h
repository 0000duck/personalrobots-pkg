/**

  @mainpage 

  @htmlinclude manifest.html

  This library provides functionality for maintaining a 2D cost map.  The primary inputs are:
  - a priori 2-D occupancy grid map
  - 3D obstacle data
  - control parameters

  This cost map is initialized with the a priori map, and thereafter updated 
  with obstacle data.  A sliding window model of persistence is used, in which
  obstacle data lives in the map for a fixed (but configurable) amount of time
  before being discarded.  The static map lives forever. Dynamic obstacle data is filtered
  to account for the robot body, and based on a z-value threshold to permit projection of 3D
  data to the 2D plane. Control parameters dictate the sliding window length, z threshold and
  inflation radius.

  For examples of usage see the test harness.
