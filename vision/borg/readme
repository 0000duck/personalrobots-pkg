HOW TO USE:

start by running scripts/perms  to ensure that you have enough permissions to open the firewire device.

then, you can use ./home and ./goto (e.g., "./goto 90" ) to make sure the stage can move around. use "./laser 1" and "./laser 0" to turn on/off the laser.

once you're ready to scan, do:

./scan_pipeline >OUTPUT.TXT

this will run the whole pipeline and export the point cloud into OUTPUT.TXT
