Implementation of mean-shift clustering from Piotr Dollar's Image & 
Video Toolbox for Matlab (http://vision.ucsd.edu/~pdollar/toolbox/doc/).
The license is LGPL.

The clustering works on arbitrary input feature spaces (i.e. does NOT 
assume the input is an image)

meanShift1.c - original implementation (unused)
meanshift_generic.cpp - modified version using ANN for nearest neighbor lookup
