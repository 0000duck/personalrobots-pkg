@b cloud_kdtree is a general library for k-D tree decomposition and ANN
(Approximate Nearest Neighbor) searches. Two libraries are wrapped at
the moment: ANN (Approximate Nearest Neighbors) from David M. Mount and
Sunil Arya, and FL-ANN (Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors)
from Marius Muja and David Lowe. By default, FL-ANN will be used, unless
USE_ANN is enabled.
