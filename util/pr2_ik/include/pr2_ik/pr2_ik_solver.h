     *
     *  This class provides a ROS/KDL based interface to the inverse kinematics of the PR2 arm. It inherits from the KDL::ChainIkSolverPos class
     *  but also exposes additional functionality to return the multiple solutions from an inverse kinematics computation. It uses an instance of
     *  a ros::Node to find the robot description. It can thus be used only if the robot description is available on a ROS param server.
     *
     *  To use this wrapper, you must have a roscore running with a robot description available from the ROS param server.
