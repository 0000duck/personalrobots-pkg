#First, we need to set frame_ids for the costmap. The global_frame refers to the
#operating frame of the costmap, and the robot_base_frame refers to the frame of
#the base link of the robot. Here, we'll set them to "map" and "base_link"
#respectively.
global_frame: /map
robot_base_frame: base_link

#Next, we'll set the some frequency parameters for the costmap. The first is the
#update_frequency. This controls how often sensor data from the world should bet
#put into the costmap. The higher this parameter is set, the more current the
#costmap's world will be. However, keep in mind that with more frequent updates
#also comes more CPU usage. We'll use a value of 5Hz as our update rate. The
#second frequency parameter that we can set on the costmap is how often to
#publish visualization data. We'll set that to 2Hz.
update_frequency: 5.0
publish_frequency: 2.0

#The transform_tolerance parameter is used to define the latency we are willing to accept
#on transforms from the robot_base_frame to the global_frame of the costmap. We'll set this
#to 0.3 seconds.
transform_tolerance: 0.3

#The obstacle_range parameter defines at what distance we will start to use sensor data
#to place obstacles into the costmap. We'll set it to 2.5 meters here which means that we'll 
#put in sensor hits that are up to 2.5 meters away from us.
obstacle_range: 2.5

#The max_obstacle_height parameter defines the maximum height of an obstacle for the costmap.
#We'll set it to 2.0 meters for our robot.
max_obstacle_height: 2.0

#The raytrace_range parameter sets how far we'll look out from the robot when raytracing freeespace.
#Here we'll set it to be 3.0 meters. Its suggested to set this parameter to be equal or greater to
#the obstacle_range parameter above to ensure that freespace is cleared out correctly.
raytrace_range: 3.0

#The following three parameters are used for inflation of obstacles within the costmap. The inscribed
#radius should be set to the radius of the inner circle of the robot. The circumscribed radius should
#be set to the radius of the outer circle of the robot. The inflation radius should be set to the maximum
#distance from obstacles at which cost information is desired. 
inscribed_radius: 0.325
circumscribed_radius: 0.46
inflation_radius: 0.55

#The observation_sources list allows users of a Costmap2DROS object to specify what topics should be used
#in conjunction with the underlying Costmap2D object. Topics should be listed here, separated by spaces and
#should be configured in their individual namespaces as shown below. Each topic in this list will be subscribed
#to and managed by the Costmap2DROS object subject to its configuration settings.
observation_sources: base_scan

#This is an example of topic configuration for the base_scan topic listed in the observation_sources list above.
#Notice that the base scan receives its own namespace to read its configuration from. 
base_scan: 
#The sensor_frame parameter specifies what frame the origin of the sensor is
#assumed to be in. Leaving this blank infers the origin
#frame from the frame_id sent in each message over the base_scan topic. Any
#other string will override the frame_id sent in the message.
  sensor_frame: base_laser

#The data_type parameter specifies what message type to expect for the topic. The
#two supported message types at this point are LaserScan and PointCloud.
  data_type: LaserScan

#The expected_update_rate parameter specifies the delay between messages that the Costmap2DROS 
#object will tolerate. For example, we expect that the base_scan should come in at 20Hz, which is
#0.05 seconds between messages. However, we are willing to tolerate some jitter and want
#to be warned when the time between messages exceeds 0.2 seconds.
  expected_update_rate: 0.2

#The observation_persistence parameter controls how long a message/observation from the topic persists
#in its associated observation buffer. In this case, we'll set the persistence to 0.0 seconds meaning
#we'll only keep the latest scan. This is fine for the base_scan because it is a planar laser that updates
#at 20Hz. However, consider the case where we have an actuated sensor, such as a tilting laser. In that
#case, we would set the observation_persistence to be equal to the tilting period. So, if the laser takes
#2 seconds to do a full sweep of the world, we'll want to set the observation_persistence parameter to 2
#seconds to make sure that we keep scans for that amount of time.
  observation_persistence: 0.0

#The marking and clearing parameters specify what functions the topic should be used for. If marking is set
#to true, observations from the topic will be put into the costmap as obstacles. If marking is set to 
#false, observations from the topic won't be put into the costmap as obstacles. If clearing is set to true,
#observations from the topic will be used to clear out freespace in the costmap. If clearing is set to false,
#observations from the topic won't be used to clear out freespace. In the case of the base_scan, we want to 
#both put obstacles in and clear obstacles from the costmap so we'll set both clearing and marking to be true.
  marking: true
  clearing: true

#The max_obstacle_height parameter specifies the maximum height reading from a sensor to be considered when
#either clearing or marking. The min_obstacle_height parameter specifies the minimum height reading from a
#sensor to be considered when clearing or marking. The base_scan corresponds to a planar laser sensor, so it
#doesn't matter what we set these values to as long as the actual height of the laser falls in-between them.
  max_obstacle_height: 0.4 
  min_obstacle_height: 0.08

#This parameter controls whether or not the Costmap2DROS object should initialize itself from the static map.
#If this parameter is set to true, the Costmap2DROS object will make a service call to the map_server and
#initialize itself based on the map returned. If the static_map parameter is set to false, the Costmap2DROS
#object will be initialized only with the data that it receives from its sensors. Since we want to demonstrate
#creating costmaps of arbitrary sizes, we'll set static_map to false here.
static_map: false

#When the rolling_window parameter is set to true, the Costmap2DROS object will always maintain a map that is
#centered around the current position of the robot. As the robot moves in the world, so too will the costmap.
#This means that the edges of the costmap will be clipped as the robot moves. If this parameter is not set, the
#map will stay fixed at its original origin. If the robot moves off the map in this situation, the costmap will
#not move with it. All queries to regions outside of the costmap will return errors.
rolling_window: true

#The width and height parameters set the width and height of the costmap in meters. To keep a map of 10 meters
#by 10 meters with the robot at the center, we'll set the values accordingly.
width: 10.0
height: 10.0

#This parameter sets the resolution of the costmap in meters/cell. To get a costmap with 2.5cm resolution, we'll set
#this parameter to 0.025 meters/cell.
resolution: 0.025

#This parameter specifies whether to use a 2D or 3D version of the costmap. To use the 3D version, recommended, use
#"voxel," to use the 2D version use "costmap."
map_type: voxel

#The following three parameters set the origin of the costmap in the X, Y, and Z dimensions.
origin_x: 0.0
origin_y: 0.0
origin_z: 0.0

#This parameter sets the vertical resolution of each voxel in meters/cell. To get voxels of height 20cm, we'll set this
#parameter to 0.2 meters/cell.
z_resolution: 0.2

#The z_voxels parameter specifies how many voxels to use vertically in the grid. The efficient voxel grid implementation we
#use only supports 16 levels of voxels. In this case, we want a voxel grid that is 2.0 meters tall, so with our z_resolution
#set to 0.2 meters/cell, we need 10 voxel levels to cover our desired height.
z_voxels: 10

#The unknown_threshold is used to define a tolerance for the number of voxel cells that can be unknown in a column before the
#column itself is considered unknown. In this case, we don't care about unknown space. In fact, the base laser will only ever
#clear out one cell in our voxel column. Therefore, we'll set the unknown threshold to be equal to the number of cells in a 
#voxel column.
unknown_threshold: 10

#The mark_threshold is used to define a tolerance for the number of voxel cells that can be marked in a column before the
#column itself is considered marked. Here, we want no tolerance for marked cells hanging alone in a column, so we'll set the
#mark_threshold to be 0.
mark_threshold: 0

#This parameter sets the scaling factor that should be applied to costs during inflation. The cost function is computed as
#follows: exp(-1.0 * cost_scaling_factor * (distance_from_obstacle - inscribed_radius)) * max_cost
cost_scaling_factor: 10.0

#This parameter sets the threshold for considering a value to be lethal when reading in the static map. Since we aren't using
#the static map in this example, this parameter won't actually be used.
lethal_cost_threshold: 100
